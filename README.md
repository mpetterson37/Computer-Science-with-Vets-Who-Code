This week we covered many topics having to deal with Computer Science. Some of the topics were easier to grasp then others... But in the end, I feel that I came out of it with a pretty good understanding of the basic underlying principles. Keeping these principles in mind over the upcoming weeks will help me to plan and develop better code.

### Topics Covered:

1. The Internet and how it works:
   * Internet Protocol Addresses
   * Internet Service Providers
   * Domain Name System
2. Big O Notation  
   * Sorting Algorithms
3. Recursion

### Explaining the Internet to a Rubber Duck

Yes, I tried my best to explain the internet to my rubber duck. You can see how it all went [here](https://medium.com/@Mpetterson37/internet-the-basics-c443d5da669f#.gig3jroee).

### Is Big O Notation really that bad?

I didn't really mind Big O Notation. I think it would be difficult to really learn the hard math behind figuring out a the efficiency of a complex algorithm. But for our purposes at this level, its not too hard to understand and I can see how it will be useful in the future. You can read all about my thought process [here](https://medium.com/@Mpetterson37/big-o-notation-for-non-cs-majors-be9b52476f22#.ffhc2qdqv) , plus you can see a picture of a llama.

### Recursion: Rinse and Repeat

Recursion was another topic that at least seems simple enough on the surface, something I can grasp the basics of now and that will be good enough for the time being. Basically: rinse and repeat until done! I tried my best to write about it from a layman's perspective.
